# Uber-pickup-in-new-york-city
This repository is for data analysis on the data provided by Uber for September 2014 of Newyork pickups

The csv file 'uber-raw-data-sep14.csv' contains all the data of (1028136, 4) dimensions.
The file had 4 columns:
- `Date/Time` that represents the time stamp for the pickup
- `Lat` that represents the lattitude value of pickup
- `Lon` that represents the longitude value of pickup
- `Base` that represents the TLC base company assosiated with the ride

The Code is provided in a script.R file and the output is in a markdown uploaded on Kaggle 
Some of the few outputs are given here
